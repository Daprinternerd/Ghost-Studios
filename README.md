This is a 3d printed workshop/studio background complete with LEDs

The rest of the build won't be able to be made in CAD, so you'll have to rely on my verbal explanation.
# Explanation of all parts in BOM
- The filament is to print the background; evidence for the exact amount is in the gallery.
- The plywood is to back the green wall and the background, the green wall will be mounted on the long side of the smaller workbench.
- The green wall is for a secondary background on the smaller workbench>
- The 3D gloop is to make a strong bond for the plastic; it is the strongest plastic bonding material I have ever used.
- The whiteboard material is to fill the gap on the wall between the main shelving unit and the Swim Gear; currently, there is a tiny pegboard there.
- Light Bar is for nice-looking footage and overall aesthetics.
- The light strips are for the logo and to run at the base of the other background.
- The tabletops are there to look like a professional workspace surface for close-up shots.
