I had the idea to start a youtube channel based around my 3d printer projects. I started my cleaning my workshop and starting to 3d model the backround for my studio. 
I basically finished the cad for it. I would show a screenshot but that is not working right now I will put all photos in a gallery in the repo. A quick explanation of what the barkround is: The backround is a voroni pattern that is 3 printed in panels. The logo in the middle is my branding and will be backlit.

I did a ton of research on YouTube studios, being primarily inspired by AboveWongArt on YouTube. I sourced filament for the background, LEDs, sliced the background to find the exact amount needed, found a nice hack for rollup fabric backgrounds, found nice fake plant wall decoration, found better Ikea table top,s and measured my workshop for all the necessary lengths of material.
